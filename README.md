- 👋 Hi, I’m @Suellenk13, my full name is Suelen Campos de Almeida.
- 👩‍💻 I started this public repository in november 2022, hoping to have a place where I can organize my projects.
- 👀 I’m interested in creating experiences, despite the fact that I enjoy learning how to code, I also love subjects such as Physics, Astronomy, History, Art, Music. 
I feel like it shapes me more into a creative and proactive person.

Thinking about keep it weekly updated, but.. 

We are not going to set a goal. <br>
We're going to leave an open goal. <br>
When we reach the goal, we double the goal. <br>
